NER stands for Named Entity Recognition. It's a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories.

🔍 What is a Named Entity?
A named entity is a real-world object that has a proper name. Common categories include:

Person names (e.g., Elon Musk)

Organizations (e.g., OpenAI, Google)

Locations (e.g., Paris, Mount Everest)

Dates and times (e.g., June 1st, 5:00 PM)

Monetary values (e.g., $1000)

Percentages (e.g., 75%)

🧠 How NER Works
Input: A text string.

Processing: NLP model analyzes the grammar, context, and structure.

Output: Tagged entities.

Example:

Input:

"Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino in 1976."

NER Output:

Apple Inc. → Organization

Steve Jobs → Person

Cupertino → Location

1976 → Date

🛠️ Use Cases
